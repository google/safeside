# How to contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Propose ideas and get feedback

To help us respect your time as a contributor and maximize the chances of your work landing in the repository, please reach out early by [creating a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/google/safeside/issues/new) to talk about the additions or improvements you want to make.

You can also take a look at our [roadmap](README.md#roadmap) to see what improvements we're most eager to see, and our [explicit non-goals](README.md#non-goals) for examples of contributions we will not accept.

Some questions or feedback might not make sense as GitHub issues. For those, we've created a public [`safeside-discuss` group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/safeside-discuss).

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

### Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

## Code style

We use [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). Please run `clang-format` on your code before sending a pull request.

### Source code headers

Every file containing source code must include a copyright and license header:
