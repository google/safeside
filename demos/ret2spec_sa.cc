/**
 * Demonstration of ret2spec that exploits the fact that return stack buffers
 * have limited size and they can be rewritten by recursive invocations of
 * another function.
 * We have two functions that we named after their constant return values. First
 * the ReturnsTrue function invokes itself kRecursionDepth times and in the
 * deepest invocation it calls ReturnsFalse function. Returns_false function
 * invokes itself kRecursionDepth times. All returns of the ReturnsFalse
 * function are predicted correctly, but returns of ReturnsTrue function are
 * mispredicted to the return address of the ReturnsFalse function, because all
 * RSB pointers were rewritten by ReturnsFalse invocations. We steer those
 * mispredictions to an unreachable code path with microarchitectural side
 * effects.
